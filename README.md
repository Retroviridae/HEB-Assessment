# HEB-Assessment


Coding Challenge
Overview:
Below are two exercises to consider.
- Select one of the two examples (or both if you feel adventurous!) to complete.
- You can use any language you see fit to accomplish them.
- Use any resources available to you (Google, GitHub, etc)
- Be creative!
- Be prepared to show your work, explain your thought process and WHY you chose to do
what you chose to do.

Example 1:
Write a simple web crawler that grabs up to 100 urls, starting from heb.com.

Example 2:
Write a function that takes a string and rewrites it so that there are no repeating characters.
Leftover characters can go at the end of the resulting string.

Expectations:
- Demonstrate working code
- Code comments
- Walk through your thought process
